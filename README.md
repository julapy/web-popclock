Pop Clock makes the hard decisions for you.

Its super simple - give it a list, set a frequency and the clock will tick through your options.

You can use it to periodically decide what you should be doing.

```

We're using it to choose the name of our new baby! (Hence the Pop in the title) We have a shortlist of names that we like but figured it would be nice for the baby to make the final decision based on the time its born :)
